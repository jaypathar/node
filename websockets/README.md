**WebSocket** protocol offers persistent, real-time, full-duplex communication by enabling the sending off small chunks of data over a single persistent connection, in both directions.

The WebSocket protocol has only two agendas:

- To open up a handshake
- to help the data transfer.

There are a few common WebSocket server libraries that make managing WebSockets easier â€“ notably **WS**, **SockJS** and **Socket.IO**.
