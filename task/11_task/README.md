# Swagger

**Swagger UI allows anyone to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It's automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.**
