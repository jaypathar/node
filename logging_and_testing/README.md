**Software testing** can be stated as the process of **verifying** and **validating** whether a software or application is bug-free, meets the technical requirements as guided by its design and development, and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all the exceptional and boundary cases.

**Verification: "Are we building the product right?"**
**Validation: "Are we building the right product?"**

Software Testing can be broadly classified into two types:

1. **Manual Testing**: Manual testing includes testing software manually, i.e., without using any automation tool or any script. In this type, the tester takes over the role of an end-user and tests the software to identify any unexpected behavior or bug.

2. **Automation Testing**: Automation testing, which is also known as Test Automation, is when the tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the product. This process involves the automation of a manual process. Automation Testing is used to re-run the test scenarios quickly and repeatedly, that were performed manually in manual testing.

### Types of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**

Unit testing is a method of testing individual units or components of a software application in isolation. It is typically done by developers and is used to ensure that the individual units of the software are working as intended.

2. **Integration Testing**

Integration testing is a method of testing how different units or components of a software application interact with each other. It is used to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when different units of the software are combined. Integration testing is typically done after unit testing and before functional testing, and is used to verify that the different units of the software work together as intended.

3. **Regression Testing**

Regression testing is a method of testing that is used to ensure that changes made to the software do not introduce new bugs or cause existing functionality to break. It is typically done after changes have been made to the code, such as bug fixes or new features, and is used to verify that the software still works as intended.

4. **Smoke Testing**

This test is done to make sure that the software under testing is ready or stable for further testing.

5. **Alpha Testing**

This is a type of validation testing. It is a type of acceptance testing which is done before the product is released to customers. It is typically done by QA people or by developers within the organization.

6. **Beta Testing**

The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software. This version is released for a limited number of users for testing in a real-time environment.

7. **System Testing**

System Testing is carried out on the whole system in the context of either system requirement specifications or functional requirement specifications or in the context of both.

8. **Acceptance Testing**

Acceptance testing is done by the customers to check whether the delivered products perform the desired tasks or not, as stated in requirements.
