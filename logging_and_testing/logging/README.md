Logging is a process of recording information generated by application activities into log files. Messages saved in the log file are called logs. A log is a single instance recorded in the log file.

Structuring application logging in Node.js is critical. When running an app locally, you can hook it to a debugger, which is excellent, to find problems when running the app. During development, you would typically use console.log to get the application logs.

But when an application goes to production and the user starts interacting with it, you canâ€™t console.log any more. If something went wrong and the app crashed, you cannot check that with the console. It would help if you had a concise, clean, and quality logging middleware such as Winston.
